# Bike-Sales-PowerBI-Dashboard

In this project I delved into deriving insights from a a dataset obtained from Kaggle where I used the dataset to build a dashboard on it.
The dashboard focuses on the distribution of profits per day,age-group,country,gender,product-color etc. It is a good dashboard that can be referenced to show which months or products should be given much more attention
